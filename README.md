#### The android application, which controls your basic life functions such as sleeping, calories and a glasses of water, counts your body mass index. It also follows the spread of a dangerous virus that is now spreading around the world.

  

## About Project

The project aims to help us control vital functions such as diet, sleeping time and water quantity. You have your own product catalogue, which you can freely modify and adapt to your needs and diet. It also has the ability to control the amount of sleep or water. The automatic history allows you to see how much you have slept, drank or eaten on a given day. The body mass index calculator allows us to control whether we are in good shape. You can also observe a pandemic situation in different countries.

## Technology

In my solution I decided to use <a href="https://reactnative.dev/">React Native</a> framework. Thanks to it I was able to create front-end of my application, which uses my own API and public API <a href="https://disease.sh/">Covid-19</a>. My back-end uses <a  href="https://expressjs.com/">express.js</a> and communicates with a non-relative database <a  href="https://www.mongodb.com/">mongoDB</a>.
